# DELETE Event Duplicate Prevention - Test Summary

## Test Date: 2025-10-17

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RLS Policy Issue ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Admin Client was still blocked by RLS WITH CHECK policy
**Root Cause**: Migration `20251017010000_fix_soft_delete_with_check.sql` was not applied to database
**Solution**: Applied migration using Supabase MCP `apply_migration`
**Verification**: Server logs show Soft Delete working with 200 OK responses (previously 500 errors)

### 2. DELETE Event Duplicate Prevention ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `/src/hooks/use-realtime-chat.ts:48-142`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Line 48-49: Added cache
const processedDeletesRef = useRef<Set<string>>(new Set());

// Line 73-74: Added cleanup
processedDeletesRef.current.clear();

// Lines 122-142: Duplicate prevention logic
case 'DELETE':
  if (oldRecord?.id && onMessageDelete) {
    const messageId = oldRecord.id;

    // Duplicate prevention check
    if (processedDeletesRef.current.has(messageId)) {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.log(`üîÑ Duplicate DELETE ignored: ${messageId}`);
      }
      return;
    }

    processedDeletesRef.current.add(messageId);
    onMessageDelete(messageId);

    // Memory management: Remove after 5 seconds
    setTimeout(() => {
      processedDeletesRef.current.delete(messageId);
    }, 5000);
  }
  break;
```

## Test Results

### Server-Side (API Route)
‚úÖ **Soft Delete** (other's messages): Working correctly with Admin Client
‚úÖ **Hard Delete** (own unread messages): Working correctly
‚úÖ **Storage Cleanup**: Files deleted successfully
‚úÖ **Database CASCADE**: message_reads references cleared properly

### Server Logs Analysis
**Before Migration**:
```
‚ùå Soft delete error details: {
  "code": "42501",
  "message": "new row violates row-level security policy"
}
DELETE /api/chat/messages/{id} 500
```

**After Migration**:
```
‚úÖ Soft delete successful
DELETE /api/chat/messages/{id} 200
```

### Client-Side (Browser)
**Note**: Duplicate prevention logs (`üîÑ Duplicate DELETE ignored`) only appear in browser console, not server logs.

**How to Verify in Browser**:
1. Open DevTools Console
2. Delete a message (triggers both Realtime DELETE + Custom Event)
3. Look for: `üîÑ Duplicate DELETE ignored: {messageId}`

## Implementation Pattern

### Defense in Depth Approach (Option C - Recommended)
1. **Realtime DELETE Event** ‚Üí handleMessageDelete()
2. **Custom Event (Hard Delete)** ‚Üí handleMessageDelete()
3. **Duplicate Prevention** ‚Üí Filter at processedDeletesRef

**Why Both Paths?**:
- **Realtime**: Multi-device sync (other users see deletion immediately)
- **Custom Event**: Backup if Realtime fails (network issues, reconnection)
- **Duplicate Filter**: Prevents double processing if both fire

## Memory Management
- **Cache Size**: Unbounded Set (clears on cleanup)
- **Entry Lifetime**: 5 seconds (auto-remove via setTimeout)
- **Cleanup Triggers**:
  - Component unmount
  - Room change
  - Manual cleanup() call

## Verification Steps

### Backend Verification ‚úÖ
```bash
# Check migration applied
npm run supabase migration list

# Monitor server logs
npm run dev
# Look for: "‚úÖ Soft delete successful" (not "‚ùå Soft delete error")
```

### Frontend Verification (Pending)
```javascript
// In browser DevTools Console:
// 1. Delete a message
// 2. Check for duplicate prevention log:
console.log(`üîÑ Duplicate DELETE ignored: {messageId}`)
```

## Files Modified

1. **`/src/hooks/use-realtime-chat.ts`**
   - Line 48-49: Added processedDeletesRef
   - Line 73-74: Added cleanup
   - Lines 122-142: Duplicate prevention logic

2. **`/supabase/migrations/20251017010000_fix_soft_delete_with_check.sql`**
   - Fixed RLS WITH CHECK policy
   - Applied via Supabase MCP

## Known Issues

### Remaining Errors (Non-Blocking)
1. **Performance Metrics**: `function update_performance_summary() is not unique`
   - Impact: Performance tracking might fail
   - Priority: Low (doesn't affect chat functionality)

2. **Build Manifest**: ENOENT errors for temp files
   - Impact: None (normal Next.js dev warnings)
   - Priority: Low (build artifacts cleanup)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **RLS Migration Applied**
2. ‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention Implemented**
3. ‚è≥ **Browser Console Verification** (requires manual testing)
4. üìã **Optional**: Add E2E test for duplicate prevention

## Conclusion

**Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**Working**:
- Soft Delete with Admin Client bypass
- Hard Delete with CASCADE cleanup
- Duplicate prevention logic (React hook)

**Pending Verification**:
- Browser console logs for duplicate filtering
- Multi-device sync confirmation

**Recommendation**: Test in browser with two users to verify:
1. Realtime sync works across devices
2. Duplicate prevention filters correctly
3. No UI glitches from double-processing
